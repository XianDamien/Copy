# Task Description
Phase 2.1: Cleanup & Foundation - Remove redundant code, unify settings architecture, and prepare the codebase for advanced features. This includes eliminating the fragmented settings system, removing the ineffective "Quick Add" feature, and relocating the card reset functionality to a more appropriate location.

# Project Overview
AnGear Language Learning Extension Phase 2 transformation focuses on creating a solid foundation by removing technical debt and architectural inconsistencies. This cleanup phase prepares the codebase for the advanced FSRS scheduler, modern UI components, and AI-powered features that will follow.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Current State Analysis

### Settings Fragmentation Issues
- **Popup Settings Button**: Calls `chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage()` opening separate options.html
- **Options Page**: Exists as standalone page with basic FSRS configuration
- **Main App Settings**: Comprehensive SettingsPage.tsx with full user configuration
- **Problem**: Users have two different settings experiences, causing confusion

### Redundant Quick Add Feature
- **Location**: src/popup/Popup.tsx contains full quick add form
- **Issues**: Single card creation is inefficient for language learning
- **User Feedback**: Described as "chicken ribs" (useless feature)
- **Impact**: Clutters popup interface, adds maintenance overhead

### Misplaced Reset Functionality
- **Current Location**: Review.tsx contains "Reset Progress" button
- **Problem**: Heavy operation (resets all deck cards) triggered from single-card view
- **Better Location**: CardBrowser.tsx where users can select specific cards
- **UX Issue**: Unexpected location for bulk operations

### File Structure Redundancy
- **Options Directory**: src/options/ contains duplicate settings logic
- **Manifest References**: options.html referenced in manifest.json
- **Build Configuration**: vite.config.ts includes options page build

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility for existing user data
- Chrome extension manifest v3 requirements
- Existing user settings must be preserved during migration
- No breaking changes to core functionality

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Settings Unification Strategy
**Approach**: Redirect all settings access to main app with URL parameters
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, consistent UX, reduced maintenance
- **Implementation**: Modify popup button to open main app with `?page=settings`
- **Migration**: Graceful removal of options page without data loss

### 2. Quick Add Removal Strategy
**Approach**: Complete removal with UI simplification
- **Benefits**: Cleaner popup, focus on core functionality
- **Replacement**: Enhanced bulk creation in main app
- **User Impact**: Improved workflow efficiency

### 3. Reset Functionality Relocation
**Approach**: Move to CardBrowser with selection-based operations
- **Benefits**: More intuitive location, selective reset capability
- **Implementation**: Add checkbox selection UI to CardBrowser
- **UX Enhancement**: Confirmation dialogs for safety

### 4. Code Cleanup Strategy
**Approach**: Systematic removal of redundant files and references
- **Benefits**: Reduced bundle size, simplified build process
- **Safety**: Thorough testing to ensure no broken references

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Settings Migration Alternatives
1. **Keep Both Systems**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
2. **Migrate Options to Popup**: Rejected due to space constraints
3. **Unified Main App**: Selected for comprehensive feature set

### Quick Add Alternatives
1. **Enhance Quick Add**: Rejected due to fundamental workflow issues
2. **Move to Main App**: Rejected due to redundancy with bulk creation
3. **Complete Removal**: Selected for simplicity and focus
