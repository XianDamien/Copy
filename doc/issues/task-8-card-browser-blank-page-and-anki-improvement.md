# Task Description
Fix card browser blank page issue and implement Anki-inspired improvements with tag filtering, sortable fields, and click-to-edit functionality.

# Project Overview
LanGear Chrome extension needs functional card browser for managing learning cards with advanced features inspired by Anki's proven design patterns.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Blank Page Issue Investigation
**Navigation Flow**: ✅ DeckList → MainApp → CardBrowser all correctly implemented
**API Methods**: ✅ getDeckById() and getCardsByDeckId() exist in ApiClient  
**Background Handlers**: ✅ GET_DECK_BY_ID and GET_CARDS_BY_DECK implemented
**Component Logic**: ✅ CardBrowser has proper loading states and error handling

**Potential Root Causes:**
- Silent API failures without error propagation
- Database empty or missing card-deck relationships
- Component stuck in loading state
- Data type mismatches between frontend/backend

## Anki Card Browser Analysis
**Repository**: https://github.com/ankitects/anki
**Tech Stack**: Rust backend, Python, Svelte frontend, TypeScript
**Key Features**: Advanced filtering, sortable columns, in-line editing, bulk operations

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Debugging Strategy
1. **Context-specific debugging**: Check background script, main app consoles
2. **Enhanced logging**: Add detailed API call tracking
3. **Data verification**: Ensure test data exists in database

## Enhancement Design
**Hybrid Approach**: Combine list and grid views with advanced filtering
- Tag-based filtering system
- Sortable key fields (due date, state, ease, interval)
- Click-to-edit with rich text highlighting
- Bulk operations for productivity

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)

**Priority:** P1 Critical (Debug) + P2 High (Enhancement)
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Functional database with test data

## Key Questions for User Input

1. **Data Availability**: Do you have test decks with cards already created? If not, should we create sample data for testing?

2. **Anki Features Priority**: Which Anki features are most important to you?
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Advanced search functionality  
   - In-line editing capabilities
   - Bulk operations
   - Statistics integration

3. **UI Preference**: Do you prefer:
   - List view (table-style like Anki)
   - Grid view (current card-based layout)
   - Both with toggle option

4. **Editing Scope**: For click-to-edit functionality, should it include:
   - Simple text editing
   - Rich text formatting (bold, italic, highlighting)
   - Tag management
   - Audio attachment handling

5. **Performance Requirements**: How many cards per deck should the browser handle efficiently?
   - < 100 cards
   - 100-1000 cards  
   - 1000+ cards

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build

# Debug extension loading
# 1. Load extension in Chrome
# 2. Open background script console  
# 3. Check main app console
# 4. Monitor API message flow
# 5. Verify database content
```
