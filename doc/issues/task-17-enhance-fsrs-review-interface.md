# Task Description
**UX Enhancement Request**: FSRS review interface lacks interaction options during card review. Users need an "Edit" button to navigate to card editing interface when they encounter cards that need correction or improvement during the review session.

**User Impact**:
- No way to edit cards during review when errors are discovered
- Must exit review session and manually find card to edit
- Breaks review flow and learning momentum
- Missing navigation between review and editing workflows

**Current State**: Review.tsx component has functional FSRS integration with Again/Hard/Good/Easy buttons, but lacks editing capabilities and improved user experience features.

# Project Overview
LanGear Chrome extension with complete FSRS algorithm integration (Task 4, Task 10). The Review component successfully implements spaced repetition with proper button interactions, but needs enhanced UX features to make the review experience more fluid and user-friendly.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Current Review Interface Assessment
**Existing Features** (from Review.tsx):
- ✅ Deck selection or automatic deck-specific review
- ✅ Card flow: Question → Answer → Rating → Next Card
- ✅ FSRS integration with Again/Hard/Good/Easy buttons
- ✅ Progress tracking (current card / total cards)
- ✅ Session completion with statistics
- ✅ Proper navigation back to deck browser

**Enhanced Features** (Implemented):
- ✅ Edit button to modify cards during review
- ✅ Skip card functionality for problematic content
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for faster interaction (1-4, E, S, Space/Enter)
- ✅ Enhanced progress indication with percentages
- ✅ Seamless review ↔ edit navigation workflow
- ✅ Session state preservation during edit operations

## Navigation Flow Analysis
**Current Review Flow**:
```
DeckList → CardBrowser → Review → Complete
         ↘ Start Learning ↗
```

**Enhanced Navigation**:
```
DeckList → CardBrowser → Review ⟷ NoteEditor
         ↘ Start Learning ↗        ↑ Edit Card
                                   ↓ Return to Review
```

## Technical Requirements
**Integration Points**:
- ✅ Review.tsx has `onEditNote` prop similar to CardBrowser
- ✅ MainApp.tsx handles review-to-edit navigation
- ✅ Session state preservation during edit operations
- ✅ Keyboard event handling for efficient interaction

## Implementation Results

### Files Modified

#### `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` (58 lines added/modified)
**Enhanced Review Interface Implementation:**

**Interface Updates**:
```typescript
interface ReviewProps {
  deckId?: number | null;
  onBack?: () => void;
  onEditNote?: (noteId: number) => void; // Added for edit functionality
}
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts System**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyPress = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (reviewState === 'answer') {
      switch (event.key) {
        case '1': submitRating('Again'); break;
        case '2': submitRating('Hard'); break;
        case '3': submitRating('Good'); break;
        case '4': submitRating('Easy'); break;
        case 'e': case 'E': handleEditCard(); break;
        case 's': case 'S': handleSkipCard(); break;
      }
    } else if (reviewState === 'question') {
      if (event.key === ' ' || event.key === 'Enter') {
        showAnswer();
      }
    }
  };
  // ... event listener setup
}, [reviewState, cards, currentCardIndex]);
```

**New Functions Added**:
```typescript
const handleEditCard = () => {
  const currentCard = getCurrentCard();
  if (currentCard && onEditNote) {
    onEditNote(currentCard.note.id);
  }
};

const handleSkipCard = async () => {
  await submitRating('Again'); // Skip by marking as 'Again'
};
```

**UI Enhancements**:
- **Progress Display**: Added percentage calculation: `{currentCardIndex + 1} / {cards.length} ({Math.round(((currentCardIndex + 1) / cards.length) * 100)}%)`
- **Edit Button**: Prominent Edit button with Edit3 icon and tooltip during answer phase
- **Skip Button**: Skip functionality with SkipForward icon for problematic cards
- **Keyboard Hints**: Visual indicators for keyboard shortcuts in UI

**Edit and Skip Buttons UI**:
```typescript
{/* 额外操作按钮 */}
<div className="mt-6 pt-4 border-t border-primary-200">
  <div className="flex justify-center space-x-4">
    {onEditNote && (
      <button onClick={handleEditCard} 
              title="编辑这张卡片 (快捷键: E)">
        <Edit3 className="w-4 h-4" />
        <span>编辑卡片</span>
      </button>
    )}
    <button onClick={handleSkipCard} 
            title="跳过这张卡片 (快捷键: S)">
      <SkipForward className="w-4 h-4" />
      <span>跳过</span>
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### `src/main/MainApp.tsx` (1 line modified)
**Navigation Integration**:
```typescript
// Before
case 'review':
  return <Review deckId={selectedDeckId} onBack={() => handleNavigation('home')} />;

// After  
case 'review':
  return <Review deckId={selectedDeckId} onBack={() => handleNavigation('home')} onEditNote={handleEditNote} />;
```

   - Four FSRS rating buttons (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
   - Edit button (only shown when onEditNote prop provided)
   - Skip button for problematic cards
   - Keyboard shortcuts: 1-4 for ratings, E for edit, S for skip

3. **Navigation**:
   - Edit button → Navigate to NoteEditor for current card
   - After editing → Return to review session
   - Session state preserved automatically

#### **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- **Question Phase**: `Space`/`Enter` → Show Answer
