# Task Description
**Learning Experience Enhancement**: While FSRS algorithm is properly implemented, users report that the spaced repetition system doesn't feel responsive or educational. The current system lacks feedback about review intervals, learning progress, and educational context that helps users understand the spaced repetition process.

**User Feedback**: 
- "Feels like pressing buttons doesn't do anything meaningful"
- "No visible step length repetition or complete review system"
- "Missing educational feedback about learning progress"

**Current State**: FSRS algorithm correctly calculates intervals and updates card states, but users don't see the immediate impact of their actions or understand how the spaced repetition system works.

# Project Overview
LanGear Chrome extension with complete FSRS integration (ts-fsrs library) and enhanced review interface. The algorithm works correctly but needs better user feedback, progress visualization, and educational features to create a satisfying learning experience.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## FSRS Algorithm Assessment
**Current Implementation** (from fsrsService.ts):
- ✅ ts-fsrs library integration with proper configuration
- ✅ Card state transitions (New → Learning → Review → Relearning)
- ✅ Difficulty and stability calculations
- ✅ Interval scheduling based on ratings
- ✅ Review log tracking and statistics

**Missing User Feedback**:
- ❌ Visible next review intervals after rating
- ❌ Learning progress explanation and context
- ❌ Card difficulty and stability visualization
- ❌ Immediate feedback about rating impact
- ❌ Educational content about spaced repetition

## User Experience Gaps
**Current Review Flow**:
```
Question → Answer → Rating (1-4) → Next Card
```

**Missing Feedback Loop**:
```
Rating → Show Next Review Date → Progress Explanation → Motivation
```

**Educational Opportunities**:
- Explain why intervals increase/decrease
- Show learning curve and retention predictions
- Provide context about optimal review timing
- Display long-term learning statistics

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Enhancement Strategy
**Primary Improvements**:
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Show next review interval after each rating
2. **Progress Visualization**: Learning curve and retention statistics
3. **Educational Context**: Explain spaced repetition principles
4. **Motivational Elements**: Achievement tracking and learning streaks

**Implementation Approach**:
- Add feedback overlay after rating submission
- Create learning analytics dashboard
- Implement progress tracking and statistics
- Add educational tooltips and explanations
