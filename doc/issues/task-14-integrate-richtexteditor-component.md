# Task Description
Integrate the existing RichTextEditor component into the note editing forms and fix text sizing inconsistencies between edit and review modes. The user reports missing highlight/underline buttons and text sizing issues, which stem from the note editor using plain textarea elements instead of the rich text editor component that was created in Task 2.

# Project Overview
LanGear is a language learning Chrome extension with spaced repetition capabilities. Task 2 created a comprehensive RichTextEditor component with formatting capabilities (bold, italic, underline, highlight) and AI assistance preparation. However, this component is not currently integrated into the actual note editing forms, causing user experience issues with missing formatting capabilities and inconsistent text display between editing and review modes.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
## Current State Investigation

**RichTextEditor Component Status**:
- ✅ Component exists in `src/main/components/common/RichTextEditor.tsx` 
- ✅ Includes TipTap integration with formatting extensions (Bold, Italic, Underline, Highlight)
- ✅ Features BubbleMenu with formatting buttons
- ✅ Supports AI assistance integration (prepared for future use)
- ❌ **NOT CURRENTLY USED** in any note editing forms

**Current Note Editing Implementation**:
- Uses plain `<textarea>` elements in `src/main/pages/NoteEditor.tsx`
- Lines 268, 286, 318 contain textarea inputs for:
  - Chinese content (line 268)
  - English translation (line 286) 
  - Personal notes (line 318)
- Basic styling with Tailwind CSS classes
- No rich text formatting capabilities

**Text Sizing Issues Identified**:
- **Edit Mode**: Uses default textarea styling (relatively small text)
- **Review Mode**: Uses `text-3xl font-bold` classes (very large text)
- **RichTextEditor**: Uses `prose prose-sm` classes (small text appropriate for editing)
- Inconsistency creates poor user experience

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must maintain form validation functionality
- Need to preserve existing onChange handlers
- Must ensure compatibility with note saving/loading logic
- Should maintain industrial design theme consistency

## Integration Requirements
1. Replace textarea elements with RichTextEditor components
2. Maintain form state management compatibility
3. Ensure proper text sizing for both edit and review modes
4. Preserve error handling and validation
5. Test BubbleMenu positioning and functionality
6. Ensure mobile responsiveness

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
## Integration Strategy Selected

**Approach**: Direct textarea replacement with RichTextEditor components

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Text Sizing**: Use appropriate sizing for different contexts
   - Edit mode: Medium text (text-base or prose) for comfortable editing
   - Review mode: Slightly larger but not excessive (text-xl instead of text-3xl)
   - Consistent typography hierarchy throughout

2. **Component Integration**: 
   - Replace textareas with RichTextEditor components
   - Maintain existing onChange handlers by adapting to HTML content
   - Keep validation and error handling intact

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Better visual hierarchy with consistent text sizing
   - Rich text formatting capabilities for enhanced note-taking
   - Improved editing experience with bubble menu

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
- **Gradual Migration**: Replace one textarea at a time - Rejected due to inconsistent UX
- **Dual Mode**: Plain text + rich text toggle - Rejected as over-engineering for current needs
- **Custom Text Sizing**: Different sizes per field - Rejected for maintaining simplicity

**Benefits of Selected Approach**:
- Immediate resolution of user-reported issues
- Consistent rich text editing throughout the application
- Better preparation for AI assistance features
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Maintains existing functionality while enhancing UX
