# Task Description
Implement user-configurable settings for the AnGear Language Learning Extension, allowing users to customize learning steps, relearning steps, daily new cards limit, and daily review limit. This builds upon the previous FSRS implementation to make the learning experience more personalized and flexible.

# Project Overview
AnGear Language Learning Extension is a Chrome extension that provides spaced repetition learning functionality. The extension uses the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm for optimal card scheduling. This task adds user configuration capabilities to make the learning experience customizable while maintaining the robust FSRS foundation.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
**Storage Requirements:**
- Need to use `chrome.storage.sync` API for cross-browser synchronization
- Settings should be stored under a single top-level key for efficiency
- Default values needed for first-time users

**UI Integration:**
- Settings page currently exists as placeholder in MainApp.tsx
- Need dedicated SettingsPage.tsx component with form inputs
- Integration with existing React state management

**FSRS Integration:**
- Current fsrsService.ts uses hardcoded values
- Need to load user settings on service initialization
- Must listen for storage changes to update settings dynamically

**Database Integration:**
- Daily limits require tracking review history
- Need to count today's new cards vs review cards
- getDueCards method needs modification for limit enforcement

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
**Approach:** Create a centralized settings management system with:
1. TypeScript interfaces for type safety
2. Settings service abstraction over chrome.storage.sync
3. React-based settings UI with real-time validation
4. Integration with existing FSRS and database services
5. Daily limit enforcement through enhanced database queries

**Advantages:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe configuration management
- Cross-browser settings synchronization
- Non-breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enhanced user experience with customizable learning

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
## Implementation Checklist

1. **Define Settings Data Structure**
   - [x] Add UserSettings interface to src/shared/types/index.ts
   - [x] Add DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS constant

2. **Create Settings Management Service**
   - [x] Create src/shared/utils/settingsService.ts
   - [x] Implement getSettings() function
   - [x] Implement saveSettings() function

3. **Implement Settings UI Page**
   - [x] Create src/main/pages/SettingsPage.tsx
   - [x] Add form inputs for all settings
   - [x] Implement save functionality with confirmation

4. **Integrate Settings UI**
   - [x] Update src/main/MainApp.tsx to render SettingsPage
   - [x] Remove placeholder settings content

5. **Update FSRS Service**
   - [x] Modify src/background/fsrsService.ts to load user settings
   - [x] Add chrome.storage.onChanged listener
   - [x] Update reviewCard logic to use configurable steps

6. **Implement Daily Limits**
   - [x] Modify getDueCards in src/background/db.ts
   - [x] Add logic to count today's reviews
   - [x] Enforce daily limits for new and review cards

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - [x] Test settings page functionality
   - [x] Verify learning steps configuration works
   - [x] Validate daily limits enforcement
   - [x] Test cross-browser synchronization

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Load extension in Chrome developer mode and test:
# 1. Settings page loads without errors
# 2. Settings can be saved and persist
# 3. Learning steps affect review behavior
# 4. Daily limits restrict card availability
```

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **src/shared/types/index.ts** - Added UserSettings interface and DEFAULT_USER_SETTINGS
2. **src/shared/utils/settingsService.ts** - New comprehensive settings management service
3. **src/main/pages/SettingsPage.tsx** - New React component with full settings UI
4. **src/main/MainApp.tsx** - Updated to import and render SettingsPage
5. **src/background/fsrsService.ts** - Enhanced with user settings integration
6. **src/background/db.ts** - Updated getDueCards method with daily limits support

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Chrome Storage Integration**: Uses chrome.storage.sync for cross-browser synchronization
- **Real-time Validation**: Settings are validated before saving with user-friendly error messages
- **Dynamic Updates**: FSRS service listens for settings changes and updates automatically
- **Daily Limits**: Database enforces daily new cards and review limits based on review history
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces and validation
- **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive UI with helpful descriptions and reset functionality

### Technical Highlights:

- Settings are stored under single 'userSettings' key for efficiency
- Graceful fallback to defaults if settings loading fails
- Non-breaking changes to existing functionality
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Industrial design theme consistency maintained
