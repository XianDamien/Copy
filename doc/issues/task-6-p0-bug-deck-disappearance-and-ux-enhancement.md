# Task Description
Fix P0 critical bug where decks disappear after creation (data loss) and implement no error feedback, plus enhance UI/UX flow for deck management:

**P0 Issues:**
1. 牌组创建后无故消失 (数据丢失): Decks disappear randomly after creation due to service worker termination before IndexedDB commit
2. 操作失败时无任何提示: No user feedback when deck creation fails, only console.error logging

**UX Enhancement:**
- Remove "Learn" and "Manage" buttons from deck list
- Make deck items clickable to navigate to Card Browser page
- Add "New Card" button to each deck item
- Create Card Browser page with "Start Learning" button

# Project Overview
LanGear is a Chrome extension for language learning using FSRS (spaced repetition). The application uses React frontend with Chrome Extension Service Worker backend and IndexedDB for data persistence. Current architecture has critical data loss issues due to optimistic UI updates and service worker lifecycle management.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Data Loss Issue:**
   - `DeckList.tsx` performs optimistic UI update: `setDecks(prev => [...prev, newDeck])`
   - Chrome Service Worker may terminate before IndexedDB transaction commits
   - UI shows deck as created but data never persisted
   - On reload, deck disappears because it was never saved

2. **No Error Feedback:**
   - `handleCreateDeck` has try/catch but only logs to console
   - No user-facing notifications for success/failure
   - Users see "nothing happened" when operations fail

3. **Current UI Flow Issues:**
   - Deck list has confusing "Learn"/"Manage" buttons
   - No direct access to deck contents
   - Card creation not directly linked to specific decks

**Key Files Analyzed:**
- `src/main/pages/DeckList.tsx`: Contains flawed optimistic update logic
- `src/background/index.ts`: Proper error handling in background script
- `src/background/db.ts`: Database operations appear correct
- `src/shared/utils/api.ts`: API client working correctly

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
**Approach 1: Pessimistic UI with Toast Notifications (Selected)**
- Remove optimistic updates
- Wait for confirmation before updating UI
- Re-fetch data from database to ensure consistency
- Add react-hot-toast for user feedback
- Create new Card Browser page
- Refactor deck list interactions

**Alternative Approach: Optimistic UI with Revert (Rejected)**
- More complex state management
- Can be jarring if items disappear on failure
- Higher risk of inconsistency

**Toast Notifications vs Modals:**
- Toast: Non-intrusive, good UX (Selected)
- Modals: Disruptive to user flow (Rejected)

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)

## Part 1: Fix P0 Bug (Data Persistence and Feedback)

### Subtask 6.1: Integrate Toast Notification System ✅
**Files:** `package.json`, `src/main/MainApp.tsx`
- [x] Install react-hot-toast dependency
- [x] Wrap App component with Toaster provider
- [x] Test basic toast functionality

### Subtask 6.2: Fix Deck Creation Logic ✅
**Files:** `src/main/pages/DeckList.tsx`
- [x] Remove optimistic update line: `setDecks(prev => [...prev, newDeck])`
- [x] Add success toast: `toast.success('牌组创建成功！')`
- [x] Add error toast: `toast.error('创建牌组失败，请重试')`
- [x] Call `loadDecks()` after successful creation to refresh from database
- [x] Apply same fixes to update and delete operations for consistency
- [x] Test deck creation success and failure scenarios

## Part 2: Implement New UI/UX Flow

### Subtask 6.3: Create Card Browser Page ✅
**Files:** `src/main/pages/CardBrowser.tsx`
- [x] Create new component accepting deckId as prop (adapted for state-based navigation)
- [x] Fetch cards using `apiClient.getCardsByDeckId(deckId)`
- [x] Display cards in a browsable list/grid with card details
- [x] Add "Start Learning" button (top-right corner)
- [x] Add "New Card" button linking to note creation
- [x] Include card detail modal for viewing card information
- [x] Test card browser functionality

### Subtask 6.4: Update Application Routing ✅
**Files:** `src/main/MainApp.tsx`
- [x] Add new page type 'cardBrowser' to state-based navigation
- [x] Integrate CardBrowser component into page rendering
- [x] Add navigation handlers for start learning and create note
- [x] Test navigation to new page
- [x] Verify deckId parameter passing

### Subtask 6.5: Refactor DeckList UI ✅
**Files:** `src/main/pages/DeckList.tsx`
- [x] Remove "Learn" and "Manage" buttons from deck items
- [x] Make deck items clickable (navigate to card browser)
- [x] Add "New Card" button to each deck item
- [x] Update styling and layout for better UX
- [x] Add onCreateNote callback for proper navigation
- [x] Test deck item interactions

## Part 3: Testing and Verification

### Subtask 6.6: Comprehensive Testing ✅
- [x] Test deck creation success with toast notification
- [x] Test deck creation failure with error toast  
- [x] Test deck list refresh after successful creation
- [x] Test deck item click navigation to Card Browser
- [x] Test Card Browser displays correct deck's cards
- [x] Test "New Card" button navigation with deckId parameter
- [x] Test "Start Learning" button (placeholder functionality)
- [x] Build verification successful - all components compile correctly
- [x] Added missing API methods: `getCardsByDeckId` and `getNoteById`

## Part 4: Documentation

### Subtask 6.7: Create Implementation Summary ✅
- [x] Document root causes and solutions
- [x] Explain technical decisions and trade-offs
- [x] Provide learning outcomes and best practices
- [x] Include performance and reliability improvements
