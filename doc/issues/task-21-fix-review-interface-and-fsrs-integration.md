# Task Description
**Fix Review Interface and FSRS Integration Issues**: Three critical issues need to be resolved:

1. **FSRS Algorithm Validation Integration**: The validation system should not have a separate page but should create 100 test cards within the existing deck system. There's also a test failure in "Rapid Review Session" that needs fixing.

2. **HTML Tags Display Issue**: During card review (4-button learning interface), HTML tags are being displayed instead of rendered content. The interface should show properly rendered content, not raw HTML markup.

3. **Review State Reset Button**: Add a "reset review state" button in the review interface to facilitate testing and allow users to restart their review progress.

**Critical Requirements**:
- Remove standalone FSRS test page and integrate validation into existing deck system
- Fix HTML rendering in review interface to show proper content
- Add review state reset functionality for testing purposes
- Ensure all FSRS tests pass without failures
- Maintain existing functionality while fixing these issues

# Project Overview
LanGear Language Learning Chrome Extension with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + IndexedDB + FSRS algorithm integration. The application has a working review system but needs fixes for proper content rendering and FSRS validation integration.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
**Current Issues Identified**:

1. **FSRS Validation Architecture Problem**:
   - ❌ Standalone FSRSTestPage creates separate interface
   - ❌ Should integrate with existing DeckList and CardBrowser
   - ❌ "Rapid Review Session" test failing
   - ✅ Test data generation working correctly

2. **HTML Rendering Issue in Review Interface**:
   - ❌ Raw HTML tags displayed instead of rendered content
   - ❌ Affects user experience during card review
   - ⚠️ Need to investigate Review.tsx component rendering logic

3. **Missing Testing Functionality**:
   - ❌ No way to reset review state for testing
   - ❌ Difficult to test FSRS algorithm with existing cards
   - ⚠️ Need convenient reset mechanism

**Key Files to Investigate**:
- `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` - Review interface with HTML rendering issue
- `src/main/pages/FSRSTestPage.tsx` - Standalone page to be removed/integrated
- `src/main/pages/DeckList.tsx` - Integration point for FSRS validation
- `src/shared/utils/fsrsTestValidator.ts` - Test failure investigation
- `src/main/MainApp.tsx` - Navigation and routing updates

**Dependencies and Constraints**:
- Must maintain existing review functionality
- FSRS validation should be seamless within normal workflow
- HTML rendering must work for all card types
- Reset functionality should be safe and reversible

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
**Three-Phase Fix Approach**:

1. **FSRS Integration Redesign**:
   - Remove standalone FSRSTestPage from navigation
   - Add "Generate Test Data" button to DeckList page
   - Integrate test data generation into existing deck creation workflow
   - Fix "Rapid Review Session" test failure
   - Make FSRS validation part of normal deck management

2. **HTML Rendering Fix**:
   - Investigate Review.tsx component for HTML tag display issue
   - Ensure proper React rendering of card content
   - Fix any dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage if present
   - Test with different card types and content

3. **Review State Reset Feature**:
   - Add "Reset Review Progress" button to Review interface
   - Implement safe reset functionality that preserves cards but resets FSRS state
   - Add confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resets
   - Provide clear feedback on reset completion

**Technical Implementation Strategy**:
- Modify DeckList to include FSRS test data generation
- Fix Review component HTML rendering logic
- Add reset functionality with proper error handling
- Remove standalone test page and update navigation
- Ensure all tests pass after fixes

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)

3. ✅ Integrate FSRSTestValidator into DeckList workflow
4. ✅ Fix "Rapid Review Session" test failure
5. ✅ Test FSRS validation within existing deck system

## Phase 2: HTML Rendering Fix
6. ✅ Investigate Review.tsx HTML tag display issue
7. ✅ Fix content rendering to show proper formatted text
8. ✅ Test with various card types and content formats
9. ✅ Ensure no HTML tags are visible to users
10. ✅ Verify rendering works across all card templates

## Phase 3: Review State Reset Feature
11. ✅ Add "Reset Review Progress" button to Review interface
12. ✅ Implement reset functionality with confirmation dialog
13. ✅ Add API method for resetting card review states
14. ✅ Test reset functionality thoroughly
15. ✅ Ensure reset preserves cards but clears FSRS progress

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
16. ✅ Run all FSRS tests to ensure no failures
17. ✅ Test complete review workflow with fixes
18. ✅ Verify HTML rendering works correctly
19. ✅ Test reset functionality in various scenarios
20. ✅ Build and verify no compilation errors

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Build and test the application
npm run build

# Test FSRS validation (should be integrated into deck workflow)
# Access via DeckList -> "Generate Test Data" button

# Test HTML rendering fix
# Navigate to Review page and verify no HTML tags visible

# Test reset functionality  
# Use "Reset Review Progress" button in Review interface
```
