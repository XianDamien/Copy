# Task Description
**Complete FSRS Implementation and Data Validation**: The application has FSRS algorithm integration but needs comprehensive validation with real test data. User requires 100 test data items to be automatically generated and added to verify that the entire FSRS workflow functions correctly - from card creation to review scheduling to long-term retention optimization.

**Critical Requirements**:
- Generate 100 diverse test cards with realistic Chinese-English content
- Validate complete FSRS workflow (creation ‚Üí due ‚Üí review ‚Üí reschedule)
- Ensure all FSRS features work: Again/Hard/Good/Easy ratings
- Test state transitions (New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Relearning)
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Create comprehensive validation UI for monitoring test results

# Project Overview
LanGear Language Learning Chrome Extension with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + IndexedDB + FSRS algorithm integration for optimized spaced repetition learning.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
**Current FSRS Integration Status**:
- ‚úÖ FSRS algorithm (ts-fsrs) properly integrated in background service
- ‚úÖ Rating system (1-4) mapped to Again/Hard/Good/Easy 
- ‚úÖ Review interface with keyboard shortcuts functional
- ‚úÖ Card state management and scheduling working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing comprehensive validation with real test data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No performance testing for large datasets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No UI for FSRS system validation

**Key Files Analyzed**:
- `src/background/fsrsService.ts` - Core FSRS integration
- `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` - Review interface
- `src/shared/utils/api.ts` - API client with review methods
- `src/shared/types/index.ts` - Type definitions

**Dependencies and Constraints**:
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3 environment
- IndexedDB storage with idb library  
- React component architecture

   - Mixed difficulty levels for realistic testing

2. **FSRS Algorithm Validation**: Comprehensive testing suite
   - Basic workflow testing (New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Review)
   - All rating scenarios (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
   - State transition verification
   - Performance testing with large datasets
   - Rapid review session simulation

3. **Validation UI**: User-friendly testing interface
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Detailed test results with metrics
