# Task Description
Redesign the Chrome extension's note editor UI to be more concise and user-friendly based on provided screenshots. Requirements:
1. Remove two-column layout and useless preview sections
2. Arrange form fields vertically (字段竖着排列)
3. Remove language restrictions from input fields (输入框的也不应该对语言有限定)
4. Create a cleaner, more focused editing experience
5. Make the UI match the design shown in user's French language learning app screenshots

# Project Overview
AnGear Language Learning Extension - Currently has a two-column note editor with Chinese/English specific fields and preview sections. User wants a simpler, vertical layout that's more universal and focused on content creation without language limitations.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
Current Issues Identified:
- Two-column layout wastes space and creates complexity
- Preview sections add unnecessary visual clutter
- Input fields have language-specific validations and labels
- Layout doesn't match the clean, vertical design shown in screenshots
- User interface assumes Chinese-to-English workflow only

Target Design (from screenshots):
- Single-column, vertical field arrangement
- Clean, minimal design focused on content entry
- Language-agnostic input fields
- Streamlined workflow without preview distractions

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
Primary approach: Redesign NoteEditor.tsx to create a cleaner, vertical layout
1. Remove two-column grid layout
2. Stack form fields vertically in logical order
3. Remove language-specific validation and labeling
4. Eliminate preview cards that add visual clutter
5. Focus on essential content entry fields only

Alternative approach: Create entirely new editor component
- Build from scratch with clean design
- Integrate with existing InteractiveEditor work
- Maintain backward compatibility

Favored: Redesign existing component for faster implementation
