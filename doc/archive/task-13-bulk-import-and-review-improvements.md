# Task 13: Bulk Import and Review Improvements

## Created On: 2024-03-21
## Created By: AI Assistant

## Task Description
Implement three key features for AnGear:
1. Bulk card import functionality
2. Review UI modifications for hidden translations
3. Learning flow adjustments with evaluation state

## Project Overview
The project requires enhancing the existing AnGear language learning application with new features to improve the learning experience and make it easier to import content.

## Analysis
Key files identified and modified:
- src/main/pages/BulkImportPage.tsx (new)
- src/main/pages/Review.tsx
- src/shared/utils/api.ts
- src/background/index.ts
- src/background/db.ts
- src/tests/bulk-import.test.ts (new)
- src/tests/review-ui.test.ts (new)
- src/tests/learning-flow.test.ts (new)

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Bulk Import Feature
- [x] Created BulkImportPage component with file upload and preview
- [x] Added bulkCreateNotes method to ApiClient
- [x] Added BULK_CREATE_NOTES handler to background script
- [x] Implemented bulkCreateNotes in DatabaseService
- [x] Added basic tests for bulk import functionality
- [ ] Add support for Quizlet import
- [ ] Add support for .apkg format

### 2. Review UI Modifications
- [x] Added translation visibility state
- [x] Added hint button functionality
- [x] Added tests for new UI behavior
- [ ] Update keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add transition animations

### 3. Learning Flow Adjustments
- [x] Added evaluation state to Review component
- [x] Implemented 15-minute review interval
- [x] Added difficulty assessment UI
- [x] Added tests for evaluation flow
- [ ] Update FSRS service for new intervals

## Next Steps
1. Add support for additional import formats:
   - Implement Quizlet import parser
   - Add .apkg format support with media handling
2. Enhance Review UI:
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for hint button
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
3. Update FSRS service:
   - Modify scheduling algorithm for evaluation-based intervals
   - Add difficulty factor to FSRS calculations
4. Add comprehensive documentation:
   - Update user guide with new features
   - Add developer documentation for import formats

## Testing Instructions
For each feature, run the following tests:

### Bulk Import Tests
```bash
npm test src/tests/bulk-import.test.ts
```

### Review UI Tests
```bash
npm test src/tests/review-ui.test.ts
```

### Learning Flow Tests
```bash
npm test src/tests/learning-flow.test.ts
```

## Implementation Notes

### Bulk Import
The bulk import feature currently supports:
- Tab-separated text files
- Basic validation and preview
- Batch creation of notes and cards
- Error handling for invalid formats

Future improvements:
- Add support for CSV with custom delimiters
- Implement progress tracking for large imports
- Add validation for duplicate entries

### Review UI
The new review interface:
- Hides translations by default
- Provides a hint button to reveal translations
- Maintains keyboard shortcuts for rating cards
- Adds evaluation state after completing review

### Learning Flow
The modified learning flow:
- Collects cards for evaluation during review
- Allows difficulty assessment for each card
- Schedules follow-up reviews based on difficulty
- Integrates with existing FSRS algorithm

## Known Issues
1. Large file imports may cause performance issues
2. Keyboard shortcuts need to be updated for hint button
3. Transition animations not yet implemented
4. FSRS integration for evaluation-based intervals pending

## Future Enhancements
1. AI-assisted bilingual text alignment
2. Batch editing in card browser
3. Import progress visualization
4. Enhanced statistics for evaluation data
