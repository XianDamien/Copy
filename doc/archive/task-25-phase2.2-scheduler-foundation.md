# Task Description
Implement the foundational scheduler service for Phase 2.2 FSRS overhaul and add the requested "Reset Card Progress" button to the review interface. This task creates the infrastructure for proper FSRS queue management while providing immediate UI improvements for card progress reset functionality.

# Project Overview
AnGear Language Learning Extension Phase 2.2 focuses on overhauling the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) system to follow Anki's proven scheduler logic. The current implementation only shows overdue cards and lacks proper daily queue management with new/learning/review card separation. This task establishes the foundation by creating the scheduler service architecture and adding user-requested reset functionality.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Current FSRS Implementation Issues

### Problem 1: Broken Queue System
- **Location**: `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` line ~85
- **Current Logic**: `apiClient.getDueCards(deckId || undefined, 20)`
- **Issue**: Only retrieves overdue cards, missing proper daily queue with new/learning/review separation
- **Impact**: Users don't get proper spaced repetition experience

### Problem 2: Missing Reset UI in Review Interface
- **Location**: `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` `renderDeckSelection()` function
- **Current State**: Only shows "复习所有到期卡片" button
- **User Request**: Add "重置卡片进度" button next to review button
- **Impact**: Users cannot easily reset card progress from main review interface

### Problem 3: Scheduler Service Architecture Gap
- **Missing Component**: `src/background/schedulerService.ts`
- **Current Approach**: Direct database calls from UI components
- **Needed**: Centralized scheduler service following FSRS best practices
- **Impact**: Difficult to implement proper queue management

## Existing Reset Functionality Analysis
- **Location**: `src/main/pages/CardBrowser.tsx` `handleResetSelectedCards()`
- **Implementation**: Works correctly with confirmation dialog
- **API Method**: `apiClient.resetCardProgress(cardId)` for individual cards
- **Gap**: No bulk reset for entire decks or all cards

## Dependencies and Constraints
- **FSRS Library**: `ts-fsrs` already integrated in `fsrsService.ts`
- **Database**: IndexedDB via `src/background/db.ts`
- **API Layer**: Chrome extension messaging via `src/shared/utils/api.ts`
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS styling

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Solution Strategy: Incremental Architecture Approach

### Option 1: Full FSRS Implementation First
- **Approach**: Implement complete scheduler logic before UI changes
- **Pros**: Comprehensive solution, proper FSRS from start
- **Cons**: Complex, high risk, delayed user feedback

### Option 2: Incremental Foundation-First
- **Approach**: Create scheduler service architecture, then implement features incrementally
- **Pros**: Lower risk, immediate UI improvements, testable components
- **Cons**: Temporary placeholder logic needed

### Option 3: UI-First Approach
- **Approach**: Add reset button first, then build scheduler
- **Pros**: Immediate user satisfaction
- **Cons**: Doesn't address core FSRS issues

**Selected Approach**: Option 2 (Incremental Foundation-First)

**Rationale**: 
- Provides immediate user value (reset button)
- Establishes proper architecture for future FSRS enhancements
- Allows testing and validation at each step
- Reduces risk of breaking existing functionality

## Technical Architecture Design

### Scheduler Service Structure
```typescript
class SchedulerService {
  // Phase 1: Foundation (this task)
  async buildQueue(deckId: number | null): Promise<Card[]>
  
  // Phase 2: Full FSRS (next task)
  async buildDailyQueue(deckId: number | null): Promise<QueueResult>
  async getNewCards(deckId: number | null, limit: number): Promise<Card[]>
  async getLearningCards(deckId: number | null): Promise<Card[]>
  async getReviewCards(deckId: number | null, limit: number): Promise<Card[]>
}
```

### API Client Extensions
```typescript
class ApiClient {
  // New methods for scheduler integration
  async buildQueue(deckId: number | null): Promise<Card[]>
  async resetCardsInDeck(deckId: number | null): Promise<void>
}
```

### Database Service Extensions
```typescript
// New methods in db.ts
async resetCardsInDeck(deckId: number | null): Promise<void>
async getCardsByState(deckId: number | null, state: CardState): Promise<Card[]>
```

- [x] Export service instance for background script integration
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for queue results

### Step 2: Extend API Client

- [x] Add `resetCardsInDeck(deckId: number | null)` method to API client
- [x] Implement Chrome runtime messaging for new methods
- [x] Add proper error handling and type safety

### Step 3: Extend Database Service
- [x] Add `resetCardsInDeck(deckId: number | null)` method to `src/background/db.ts`
- [x] Implement bulk card state reset functionality
- [x] Add transaction support for data consistency
- [x] Add logging for reset operations

### Step 4: Update Review Interface
- [x] Modify `src/main/pages/Review.tsx` `renderDeckSelection()` function
- [x] Add "重置卡片进度" button next to "复习所有到期卡片"
- [x] Implement `handleResetDeckCards()` function with confirmation dialog
- [x] Replace `apiClient.getDueCards()` with `apiClient.buildQueue()` in `startReview()`
- [x] Add proper error handling and user feedback
