# Task Description
Implement a comprehensive Note Context System that enables AI to read all note field contents and provide context-aware responses. This includes creating enhanced AI-related type definitions, context collection utilities that work with all note types, and a temporary AI insight overlay component for displaying AI responses. The system should prepare the foundation for context-aware AI assistance without over-engineering the implementation.

# Project Overview
LanGear is a language learning Chrome extension with spaced repetition capabilities. Following the completion of Task 1 (system cleanup) and Task 2 (RichTextEditor component), Task 3 focuses on building the infrastructure needed for intelligent AI assistance. The system must work with all existing note types (CtoE, Retranslate, SentenceParaphrase, Article) and provide a clean foundation for the AI service implementation in Task 5.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
From Tasks 1-2 completion, we have:
- Clean codebase with flawed RichContent system removed
- RichTextEditor component with basic AI assistance preparation
- Existing note types with different field structures requiring unified context handling
- TipTap integration ready for AI overlay positioning

Required capabilities identified:
- Enhanced NoteContext interface with all necessary fields for AI consumption
- Context collection utilities that can extract data from any note type
- AI response interfaces for different types of assistance (define, explain, translate, grammar)
- Temporary overlay component for displaying AI insights without persistent storage
- Backward compatibility with existing note structures

Technical constraints:
- Different note types have varying field structures (CtoE: chinese/english/pinyin/notes vs Retranslate: originalText/userTranslation/notes)
- AI context must be optimized for token limits and relevance
- Overlay positioning must work with TipTap editor bubble menus
- All components must follow industrial design theme

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
**Architecture selected**: Layered approach with clear separation of concerns

**Key design decisions**:
1. **Type Organization**: Dedicated `aiTypes.ts` file for all AI-related interfaces
2. **Context Collection**: Utility functions that can extract fields from any note type dynamically
3. **AI Response Handling**: Structured interfaces for different AI action types
4. **Overlay Design**: Simple, dismissible component with copy functionality and intelligent positioning
5. **Integration Pattern**: Enhanced RichTextEditor integration without breaking existing functionality

**Alternative approaches considered**:
- Monolithic context object: Rejected due to complexity and memory usage
- Note type-specific context collectors: Rejected as it would require maintenance for each note type
- Persistent AI annotations: Rejected per Task 1 learnings about wrong abstractions
- Complex overlay with multiple actions: Rejected in favor of simple, focused design

**Benefits of selected approach**:
- Scalable to new note types without code changes
- Memory efficient with context optimization
- Simple integration points for future AI services
- Consistent with industrial design patterns
- Maintains separation between AI features and core note functionality
