# Task-Driven Learning Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Task:** task-26-task-driven-learning-architecture  
**Protocol:** RIPER-5 + Multidimensional + Agent Protocol

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Problem
User reported that cards were not reappearing at 1min/10min intervals like Anki during review sessions, expecting traditional spaced repetition behavior.

### Technical Investigation
Through systematic analysis, we discovered that:
1. **AnGear's FSRS-only approach**: All scheduling was handled by FSRS, including short-term learning
2. **Missing learning steps implementation**: Learning steps configuration existed but was unused
3. **Philosophical mismatch**: Traditional time-based repetition vs. task-based active learning

### Core Insight
The perceived "bug" revealed a fundamental opportunity to implement AnGear's unique educational philosophy: **prioritizing active language production over passive recognition**.

## Solution Architecture

### Task-Driven Learning Philosophy
**"Once a user successfully completes a translation or retelling task, that card should be considered graduated."**

This principle recognizes that successful active language production is a stronger indicator of mastery than passive recognition.

### Hybrid Implementation

#### 1. Task-Driven Mode (Default)
- **New/Relearning Cards**: Show task completion interface
- **Task Completion**: User inputs translation/retelling → Immediate graduation to Review
- **Task Failure**: Card remains in task phase for retry
- **Review Phase**: FSRS handles all long-term scheduling

#### 2. Traditional Mode (Advanced)
- **Learning Steps**: Anki-style time-based intervals (1min → 10min)
- **Progressive Graduation**: Cards advance through configured steps
- **Full Compatibility**: Maintains existing Anki workflows

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema (v2 → v3)
```typescript
interface Card {
  // ... existing fields
  learningStep: number; // 0=task pending, 1=graduated (task mode) | step index (traditional mode)
}

interface UserSettings {
  // ... existing fields
  enableTraditionalLearningSteps: boolean; // false=task-driven, true=traditional
}
```

#### State Machine Logic
```typescript
// Central dispatcher in fsrsService.ts
async reviewCard(cardId: number, rating: AppRating) {
  const settings = await getSettings();
  
  if (settings.enableTraditionalLearningSteps) {
    return this.handleTraditionalLearningSteps(card, rating);
  } else {
    return this.handleTaskDrivenLearning(card, rating);
  }
}
```

#### Conditional UI
```typescript
// Review.tsx conditional rendering
{shouldShowTaskInterface() ? (
  <TaskCompletionInterface />
) : (
  <TraditionalRatingButtons />
)}
```

## Key Benefits

### Educational Advantages
1. **Active Learning**: Focus on language production rather than passive recognition

4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Eliminates arbitrary timing decisions

### Technical Advantages
1. **FSRS Optimization**: Leverages FSRS for what it does best (long-term scheduling)
2. **Hybrid Flexibility**: Supports both modern and traditional approaches
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users can continue with familiar workflows
4. **Database Migration**: Seamless upgrade path for existing data

### User Experience
1. **Clear Mode Selection**: Intuitive settings with comprehensive explanations
2. **Contextual UI**: Interface adapts based on card state and user preferences
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features available but not overwhelming
4. **Responsive Design**: Works across all screen sizes

## Implementation Results
