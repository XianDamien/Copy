# Task 2: UI Architecture Integration

## Objective
Integrate DeckList component into MainApp with simple navigation system and prepare for additional pages.

## Implementation
Transformed MainApp from a standalone deck manager to a navigation-based application:

### Files Modified
1. **src/main/MainApp.tsx**
   - Added DeckList component import
   - Implemented page-based navigation system
   - Created navigation state management
   - Added placeholder pages for future features
   - Integrated active navigation styling

### Key Changes
- **Navigation System**: Simple state-based routing with 5 pages (home, notes, review, stats, settings)
- **DeckList Integration**: Home page now uses the existing DeckList component
- **Active Navigation**: Visual feedback for current page selection
- **Deck Selection**: Clicking "Learn" or "Manage" navigates to notes page with deck context
- **Placeholder Pages**: Ready structure for upcoming note creation and review features

### Navigation Structure
```
Home (DeckList) → Notes (Deck-specific) → Review → Stats → Settings
```

### UI Features
- Active page highlighting in navigation bar
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Deck context preservation when navigating to notes
- Consistent industrial design theme

## Tests Added
- No new tests required for navigation
- Existing DeckList tests continue to work

## Verification
- [x] Project builds successfully
- [x] Navigation between pages works
- [x] DeckList component properly integrated
- [x] Deck selection triggers navigation to notes page
- [x] Active page styling functions correctly
- [x] All placeholder pages display correctly

## Issues/Notes
- selectedDeckId preserved for future note creation feature
- Navigation is simple state-based (no React Router needed for this scope)
- Placeholder pages ready for Task 3 (Note Creation) and Task 4 (Review)
- Industrial design theme maintained throughout

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Navigation system ready, DeckList integrated, prepared for feature development
