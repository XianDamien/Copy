# LanGear Language Extension - Development Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**LanGear** (formerly AnGear) is a Chrome extension for language learning using spaced repetition, specifically designed for Chinese-to-English translation practice. The project uses modern web technologies with an industrial design theme.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (industrial theme)
- **Build Tool**: Vite + Chrome Extension Plugin
- **Algorithm**: FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)
- **Database**: IndexedDB for local storage
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## ðŸ“‹ Completed Development Tasks

### Task 0: Project Name Change (AnGear â†’ LanGear)
**What was done:**
- Renamed the project from "AnGear" to "LanGear" throughout the codebase
- Updated all references in package.json, vite.config.ts, type definitions, and UI components
- Created proper documentation structure in `doc/tasks/`

**Beginner Lesson:** When changing project names, you need to update them everywhere - not just the display name but also in configuration files, type definitions, and database schemas.

### Task 1: API Consistency Fixes
**What was done:**
- Fixed mismatches between frontend API calls and backend implementations
- Added compatibility methods for smooth integration
- Corrected TypeScript errors in components
- Ensured build process works correctly

**Beginner Lesson:** Frontend and backend need to "speak the same language" - API method names and parameters must match exactly, or you'll get confusing errors.

### Task 2: UI Architecture Integration
**What was done:**
- Transformed the main app from standalone to navigation-based
- Implemented 5-page navigation system (home, notes, review, stats, settings)
- Created smooth page transitions and state management
- Integrated existing components into the new architecture

**Beginner Lesson:** Good navigation structure is crucial for user experience. Plan your app's flow before coding individual features.

### Task 3: Chinese-to-English Note Creation
**What was done:**
- Built a comprehensive note editor with dual-panel layout
- Implemented real-time card preview as users type
- Added form validation for Chinese and English text
- Created API integration for saving notes to the database
- Maintained industrial design consistency

**Key Features:**
- Chinese text input (left panel) with character validation
- English translation input (right panel)
- Optional Pinyin pronunciation guide
- Personal learning notes section
- Live preview of how the card will look during review

**Beginner Lesson:** Form validation is essential - always check user input before saving it. Real-time preview helps users understand what they're creating.

### Task 4: Basic Card Review Interface
**What was done:**
- Created complete review system with deck selection
- Implemented card flow: Question â†’ Show Answer â†’ Rating
- Integrated FSRS algorithm for spaced repetition scheduling
- Added progress tracking and session management
- Built comprehensive error handling

**Key Features:**
- Choose specific deck or review all due cards
- Clean card display showing Chinese text first
- FSRS rating buttons: Again (1), Hard (2), Good (3), Easy (4)
- Progress bar and completion tracking
- Session completion screen with statistics

**Beginner Lesson:** User feedback is crucial - always show progress, handle errors gracefully, and provide clear completion states.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Bug Fix: Chrome Extension Loading Error

### The Problem
After development, the Chrome extension failed to load with this error:
```
Failed to load extension
Could not load icon 'icons/icon16.png' specified in 'icons'
Could not load manifest.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
**What went wrong:** The build system expected icon files to be in `public/icons/` (source folder) but they were located in `/icons/` (project root). During the build process, Vite couldn't find the icons to copy them to the final `dist/` folder.

### The Fix
```bash
# 1. Create the correct directory structure
mkdir -p public/icons

# 2. Move icons to the correct location
cp icons/*.png public/icons/

# 3. Rebuild the extension
npm run build
```

### Why This Happened
In Vite projects, static assets (like images, icons) need to be in the `public/` folder to be automatically copied to the build output. The Chrome extension manifest was correctly configured to reference `icons/icon16.png`, but the build process couldn't find the source files.

**Beginner Lesson:** Build tools have specific expectations about file locations. Always check your build tool's documentation for where to place static assets.

## ðŸŽ“ Key Learning Experiences for Beginners

### 1. **Project Structure Matters**
```
src/           <- Your source code
public/        <- Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
dist/          <- Build output (what actually runs)
package.json   <- Project configuration
vite.config.ts <- Build tool configuration
```

### 2. **Build Process Understanding**
- **Source files** (what you edit) live in `src/` and `public/`
- **Build process** transforms and combines your code
- **Output files** (what the browser uses) go to `dist/`
- Always rebuild after changing configuration or adding assets

### 3. **Chrome Extension Basics**
- `manifest.json` is the "birth certificate" of your extension
- Icons must exist in the specified paths
- Extensions have strict security requirements
- Test in browser's developer mode before publishing

### 4. **Error Debugging Process**
1. **Read the error message carefully** - it usually tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check file paths** - are files where the system expects them?
3. **Verify configuration** - does your config match your file structure?
4. **Rebuild and test** - changes don't take effect until you rebuild

### 5. **API Development Best Practices**
- **Frontend and backend must match** - same method names, same parameters
- **Handle errors gracefully** - show user-friendly messages
- **Validate all input** - never trust user data
- **Test API calls** - make sure they actually work

### 6. **UI/UX Principles Applied**
- **Show progress** - users want to know where they are
- **Provide feedback** - confirm when actions succeed
- **Handle empty states** - what happens when there's no data?
- **Make navigation clear** - users should never be lost

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture Highlights

### Database Design
- **IndexedDB** for offline storage
- **FSRS algorithm** for optimal review scheduling
- **Structured data** with proper TypeScript types

### Component Architecture
- **React functional components** with hooks
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Modular design** - each feature is self-contained
- **Consistent styling** with Tailwind CSS

### Build Configuration
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Chrome extension plugin** for proper manifest generation
- **TypeScript compilation** for type checking
- **Asset processing** for icons and styles

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Add comprehensive testing** - restore test files with proper Jest configuration
2. **Implement statistics page** - show learning progress and charts
3. **Add settings page** - customize FSRS parameters and preferences

### Future Features
1. **Audio support** - pronunciation practice and playback
2. **Import/export** - Anki deck compatibility
3. **Cloud sync** - backup and restore user data
4. **AI features** - automated translation suggestions

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Beginners

1. **Always read error messages completely** - they contain the solution 90% of the time
2. **Use TypeScript** - it catches errors before they become bugs
3. **Test in small pieces** - don't build everything then test everything
4. **Keep backups** - use Git to save your progress frequently
5. **Documentation is your friend** - check official docs when stuck
6. **Build often** - catch problems early rather than at the end
